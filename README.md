# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data---Udacity-Project
Professional Analyst Udacity Project

In this Udacity project, we analyze dataset related to bike share systems for three cities in the US, namely: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

We should Write a python code to import the data and trying to answer the required questions by computing descriptive statistics. 

In this scripted code, we try to create an interactive experience to present these statistics.

To complete this project, we require the following softwares:
- Python
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application

The Datasets are also shared here. The datasets provided by Motivate company, a bike share system provider in the US. The files contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities, which are commprised of the following six columns:

1. Start Time
2. End Time
3. Trip Duration
4. Start Station
5. End Station
6. User Type
But the Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: Gender and Birth Year
